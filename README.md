# Handwritten digit recogniser by pytorch.

## Description

### This is a study project which sort handwritten digits. I used libraries torch, numpy and for visualization of graphs - matplotlib.

### Architecture:
* Fully connected neural network with 100 hidden neurons;
* Functions of activation - Sigmoid;
* Optimizer - Adam with learning rate 0.01;
* Loss function - cross entropy;

### Finally I've got result 96% correct identifications.
